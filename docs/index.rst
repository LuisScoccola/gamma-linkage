Persistable: persistent and stable clustering
=============================================

Persistable is a density-based clustering algorithm intended for exploratory data analysis.
What distinguishes Persistable from other clustering algorithms is its visualization capabilities.
Persistable's interactive mode lets you visualize multi-scale and multi-density cluster structure present in the data.
This is used to guide the choice of parameters that lead to the final clustering.
